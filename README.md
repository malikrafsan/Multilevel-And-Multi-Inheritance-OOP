# Day 3 Assignment Specification

## Description

This class also has some basic functionality such as refuel, turn on vehicle etc. Implement as many child class as you like. The more object oriented programming concept you use the better. Also create a program demonstrating the code you have implemented.

## Deliverables
1. Fork this repository into your group.
2. Create a `development` branch in the forked repository.
3. Create a folder with your NIM as the folder name and implement your changes in the folder.
4. Create a README inside the folder to explain your work and how to run it.
5. Only push your source code and markdown file. (use [gitignore](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gitignore-what-is-it-and-how-to-add-to-repo/))
6. Submit your work after the due date by creating a merge request (MR) to [this repository's master branch](https://gitlab.com/dagozilla/academy/2021-internship1/assignment/day-3).
7. Cite references you used in this assignment.
